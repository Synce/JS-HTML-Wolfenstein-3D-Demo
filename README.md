# Wolfenstein 3D  in JS
### Description
This is school proejct made entirely in vanilla JS (only server to host this is a package). 
My first  bigger OOP project.  Its my summary of what i learned in one year of programming.
My goal was to create engine that is capable of  adding new enemies/levels/etc.  
And I think I archived it.
